This is the Repository for CS 216 Everything Data. 

[The World Happiness Report](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness?select=2019.csv),
first published in 2012, uses Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita,
family, life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and absence of government corruption as parameters to
measure happiness of citizens across the world. By reflecting the impact of big events and government
policies on the happiness of populations, the report allows policymakers and researchers to evaluate past
policies and to make informed future political decisions.We plan to investigate: 
1. How are parameters such as GDP per capita and life expectancy related to happiness scores of
citizens in a particular country? Which parameters included in the Report are statistically
significant among all countries?
2. Do developed countries overall have a different set of statistically significant parameters than
developing countries?
3. Is there any country experiencing significant increase/decrease in happiness score over the
duration of the Report, and which parameters are the most significant in affecting the changes?
